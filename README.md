# Lima Districts Analysis

## Business Problem

Lima is the capital of Peru, and it's a city with diverse and culturally rich districts due to the immigration of provincial cities to the capital that occurred during the 80s and 90s. Due to this, there are some districts that are marginally different in their economic and commercial proposal to the city. The objective of this project is to identify these differences based on the number of shopping centers, local businesses and offices.

## Data Source

For the codification of the city's districts and neighbourhoods the data will be sourced from wikipedia and INEI (National Institute of Statistics and Information). Alongside with this dataset, foursquare will be used to retreive the venues information in the city.
